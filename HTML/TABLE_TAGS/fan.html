    </div>
    <div class="div">The first ceiling fan was invented in late 1800s by <b>Philip Diehi</b>. Who use a sewing machine
        motor to power it. A ceiling fan has motor which rotates with blade.A fan works by converting electrical energy
        into mechanical energy to create airflow and a cooling effect. The fan's motor, typically an electric motor,
        rotates the blades, which push air and create a breeze. This breeze helps to evaporate sweat, reducing body heat
        and providing a cooling sensation.
