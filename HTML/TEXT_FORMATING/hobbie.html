            <p>Pani puri, a popular Indian street food, is a bite-sized chaat made of a hollow, crispy puri filled with a mixture of potatoes, chickpeas, onions, and spices, then dipped in a tangy, flavored water, usually tamarind or mint. The puri is often topped with a variety of chutneys and spices. </p>

            </p>Sport is a form of physical activity or game.[1] Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds.</p>

            <p>Art and craft are creative activities involving handwork and imagination, often used for self-expression and the creation of useful or beautiful objects. While both involve making things, art tends to emphasize personal expression and aesthetic qualities, while craft often focuses on utility and traditional skills passed down through generations.</p>
