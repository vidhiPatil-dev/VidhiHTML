        <h1>My father</h1>
        <p>My Father name is chandradip.He is a teacher.A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations. Dad, as I reflect on our journey together, I'm filled with an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the incredible man you are. You've always been more than just my father; you've been my confidant, my mentor, and my best friend. From those early days of scraped knees and bedtime stories to the more recent challenges and triumphs, you've been my unwavering source of strength and encouragement.
